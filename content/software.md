# Software


Some of the software that I've been working on and is publicly available.





## My Own Work

-   [Public Code](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/published_thingies)  
    Collection of various codes, scripts and python modules, mainly for learning/teaching matters.

-   [Coding Templates](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/coding_templates)  
    Various how-to's for different programming languages and some libraries with those languages, along with a few algorithm demonstrations.  
    So far includes C, c++, python, fortran, LaTeX, and bash.

-   [Astro Meshless Surfaces](https://pypi.org/project/astro-meshless-surfaces/)  
    A small, inefficient python module for computing effective surfaces for meshless methods of particle hydrodynamics the [Hopkins 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7395) way or the [Ivanova 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4302) way.  
    It's only written for 2d computations and meant to test things out, generate some plots etc, not to be used for serious computations.   
    Also includes simple reading-in functions for [SWIFT](https://ascl.net/1805.020) hdf5 output.

-   [This homepage](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/mladenivkovic.github.io)    
    Source code for this homepage.

-   [Mesh-Hydro](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/mesh-hydro)   
    A project to learn about essentials of (finite volume/finite difference) numerical conservation law and hydrodynamics solvers. Written explicitly so it is easy to read, play with, and extend. Works in 1D and 2D.

-   [metalmaps](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/metalmaps)  
    Python matplotlib colormaps based on heavy metal and classic rock album artworks.  [Click here for a full gallery of the available colormaps](metalmaps/metalmaps.html).










## Codes I've contributed to

-   [Ramses](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses/src/master/)  
    an open source code to model astrophysical systems. My contibution is the particle unbinding and mergertree patch.


-   [pNbody](https://gitlab.com/revaz/pNbody)  
    a parallelized python module toolbox designed to manipulate and display
    interactively very large N-body systems


-   [SWIFT](http://swiftsim.com)  
    a hydrodynamics and gravity code for astrophysics and cosmology.


-   [Peano](http://www.peano-framework.org)  
    a framework for solvers operating on dynamically adaptive Cartesian meshes.








## Docs


-   [Debugging Notes](https://obswww.unige.ch/~ivkovic/debugging/)  
    A collection of debugging hints for software I work with

-   [Instructions](https://obswww.unige.ch/~ivkovic/instructions/)  
    Various how-to's for different software, hacks, patches... Mainly stuff I want to write down
    because I can't be bothered to memorize it.

-   [Misc Notes](https://obswww.unige.ch/~ivkovic/notes_on_codes/)  
    Various notes on minor software specific stuff. Essentially a documentation add-on/extension.
