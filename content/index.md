# Mladen Ivkovic's Homepage 


Hi there! Welcome to my homepage!

[(Not sure how to pronounce my name?)](my_name.html)

Currently I'm a postdoctoral research associate at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/) 
in the [Scientific Computing Group](https://scicomp.webspace.durham.ac.uk) 
of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/),
working on task-based SPH formalisms and the performance prediction and
optimisation thereof with the [Peano](http://peano-framework.org) framework.
In a nutshell, we are researching how to design and write scientific
software to solve numerical fluid dynamics using particle methods with
maximum performance and efficiency, preparing them for exa-scale computing facilities.

My background is in physics and computational astrophysics. I'm especially 
interested in algorithms and numerical methods for high performance scientific 
computing such as (astro)physical simulations and on-the-fly analysis thereof. 
In terms of applications, so far my fields of research span halo finding, 
merger-tree building, computational fluid dynamics (using Finite Volume methods, 
Finite Volume Particle Methods, and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics), and 
radiative transfer/radiation hydrodynamics. I have worked on and with astrophysical
codes like [SWIFT](https://swiftsim.com) and [RAMSES](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses/src/master/).
