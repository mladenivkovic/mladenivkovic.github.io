# Mladen Ivkovic's Homepage 


Hi there! Welcome to my homepage!

[(Not sure how to pronounce my name?)](my_name.html)

Currently I'm a postdoctoral research associate at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/) 
in the [Scientific Computing Group](https://scicomp.webspace.durham.ac.uk) 
of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/),
working on task-based SPH formalisms and the performance prediction and
optimisation thereof with the [Peano](http://peano-framework.org) framework.

My background is in physics and astrophysics, with heavy emphasis on
computational astrophysics and software development for High Performance
Computing simulations and on-the-fly analysis. So far, my fields of research
span halo finding, mergertree building, computational fluid dynamics (using
Finite Volume methods, Finite Volume Particle Methods, and Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics), and radiative transfer. I have worked on and with astrophysical
codes like [SWIFT](https://swiftsim.com) and [RAMSES](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses/src/master/).
