## Debugging and Performance Analysis Tools

- [MUST](https://www.i12.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/nrbe) <br>
  "Marmot Umpire Scalable Tool". Detects usage errors of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and reports them to the user.
  Version 1.10 played well with SWIFT. Very useful to find errors, detect deadlocks, and check source code for valid usage.
  [Github mirror to tutorial](https://github.com/mladenivkovic/must-tutorial).

- [MAQAO](http://www.maqao.org/) <br>
  "Modular Assembly Quality Analyzer and Optimizer" is a performance analysis and optimization framework operating at binary 
  level with a focus on core performance. Very user friendly, very beginner friendly. Will e.g. give you suggestions how to
  re-write your loops so that they vectorize, or what compiler flags to use.

- [POP](https://pop-coe.eu/further-information/learning-material) <br>
  "Perfomance Optimisation and Productivity - A centre of excellence in HPC". Learning material and documentation on performance
  analysis, performance metrics. Includes tutorials for MPI, OpenMPI, and tutorials and user guides performance analysis tools 
  such as [Scalasca](https://www.scalasca.org/) and [Score-P](https://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/).

- [Darshan](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/darshan/) <br>
  [(github)](https://github.com/darshan-hpc/darshan) A lightweight lightweight I/O characterization tool and profiler.
