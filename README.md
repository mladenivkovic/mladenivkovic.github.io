My personal homepage
===========================


Intended to be written such that you just can clone the repository
in your /public directory. Then create a symbolic link to the
public/homepage/index.shtml file in /public, and it should work out
of the box.

The actual files are not included in the git repo, you'll have to 
rsync them manually. They just got too large over time.
